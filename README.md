## Description

I developed this social network application as a personal challenge to explore implementing MongoDB. The app is designed to provide people who wish to express their thoughts and opinions. During development, I encountered several challenges, the most memorable one was the issue in my seed.js file. Initially, the file struggled to establish connections between users and their respective thoughts. I worked with my tutor and we resolved the issue, ensuring associations between users and their thoughts.
